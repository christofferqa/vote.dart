### Authors
 * [Kevin Moore](https://github.com/kevmoo) ([@kevmoo](http://twitter.com/kevmoo))

### Notes
 * `vote.dart` assumes the contents of [dartlib](https://github.com/kevmoo/dartlib) are in an adjacent directory named `dartlib`.
     * _Once [pub](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/pub-package-manager/) is stable, dartlib will be a registered dependency._
